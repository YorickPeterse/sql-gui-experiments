# SQL GUI: D

D implementation of the GUI.

Note that because I'm pretty bad at D the code assumes the current working
directory is the directory containing this README file. In other words, you can
not run the binary from anywhere else.

## Requirements

* MySQL
* Dub
* GTK+ 3.0 or newer

## Usage

Simply run `dub` in this directory and you're good to go.
