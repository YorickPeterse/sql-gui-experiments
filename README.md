# SQL GUI Experiments

A GTK 3 GUI for running SQL queries, written in various languages as an
experiment.

None of the code in this repository is production ready. In fact, most of it is
put together hastly as I just wanted to see how things would work out.

Most code uses hardcoded credentials. The implementations only support
PostgreSQL unless stated otherwise.

## Used Languages

* D: only supports MySQL at the moment as I originally wrote it on a laptop that
  didn't have PostgreSQL set up.
* Ruby
