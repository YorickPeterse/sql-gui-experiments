# SQL GUI: Ruby

Ruby implementation of the GUI.

## Requirements

* Ruby (MRI/Rubinius, JRuby doesn't work sadly due to `pg` being a C extension)
* PostgreSQL
* GTK+ 3.12 or newer

## Usage

First install the required Gems:

    bundle install

Now you can run the application by just running `ruby app.rb`.
